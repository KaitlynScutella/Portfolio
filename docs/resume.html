            <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
            <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
                list. Your list can contain anything you'd like, and does not have to be in any specific order! </p>
            <ul>
                <li>tea</li>
                <li>coffee</li>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>juice</li>
                <li>water</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very
                similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a
                web browser. It is used to a list where you put things in order from first to last.</p>
