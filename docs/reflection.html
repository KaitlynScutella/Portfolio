        <p> As a new learner for web development, I found the most significant challenges to be memorizing all the different types of code. There are so many different block elements to remember, that it can get very confusing. When changing the styling and layout, it's a very tedious process. When editing something, such as a picture, you need to know exactly what you're looking for, and the sizing, and the position. The layout however can be fun to do once you get the hang of it, because you can play around with the coloring, the fonts, the sizing, and make it look however you would like it to look. </p>
        <p> It is extremely necessary to learn the coding. While its difficult, you cannot get anywhere if you don't know what elements do what. Each element will make your website look different, and when you know what they all do, it'll make it significantly easier to decide what to use. For example, when it is smarter to use a paragraph element over a heading element. </p>
        <p> Making a website has been very hard, but it can become very useful. Making a website may come in handy when it comes to my future, depending on what field I may be going into. For example, if I were to open my own business, I would have this advantage and be able to make a website on my own, rather than having to go forward with finding someone to do it for me. I would like to improve on css styling. Once you get the hang of it, I think it was very easy to understand. But a big part of the styling is making sure it looks good, so I would like to learn more about what fonts look best, what sizes look like, etc. </p>
        <p> This has been a very difficult learning experience, but I think in the long run it will be worth it. The more I learn, the more I will understand, and I could always use this to help others. Technology has become huge today, so the more I know, the more I can use it to my advantage.</p>
