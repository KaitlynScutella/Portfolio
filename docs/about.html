            <h2>Some places I have traveled!</h2>
            <p> I only recently have started to travel, but it is one of my favorite hobbies. </p>
        <section>
            <h2> New York City!</h2>
            <img src="images/ny.jpg" id="ny"/>
            <p> New York City is by far my favorite travel place yet. Many people aren't the biggest fans of New York because it's so loud and busy, but that was my favorite part.</p>

            <h2> Arizona!</h2>
            <img src="images/arizona.jpg" id="az"/>
            <p> Arizona gets a lot of hate for being so hot, but it is far more than just the heat. It's gorgeous, and theres so much more to do in the outdoors here than Erie!</p>

            <h2>Philadelphia!</h2>
            <img src="images/philly.jpg" id="philly"/>
            <p> My favorite movie franchise, Rocky, was based in Philly, so I had to go! The city is awesome here, it feels so authentic. </p>
