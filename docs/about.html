            <p>I have never been a very tech-savy person, and HTML isn't too hard for me! Using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a> is one of the best websites when you need help.</p>
            <p> Using the 'p' element is how you make paragraphs. Paragraphs are used in any way you want! </p>
            <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
                page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
            <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
                list. Your list can contain anything you'd like, and does not have to be in any specific order! </p>
            <ul>
                <li>tea</li>
                <li>coffee</li>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>juice</li>
                <li>water</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very
                similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a
                web browser. It is used to a list where you put things in order from first to last.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>breakfast</li>
                <li>lunch</li>
                <li>dinner</li>
                <li>dessert</li>
                <li>snacks</li>
